Routine to analyse surface displacements measured by AZMP buoys.
NetCDF files for different level of processing are generated :

    lvl0: displacements remapped to a regularly spaced 2.5Hz grid, and
          controled for quality
    lvl1: wind data and wave bulk parameters computed from 30-minutes records
          of lvl0 data, and controled for quality
    lvl2: auxiliary variables measured by the platform and remmaped to a
          regularly spaced 30-minutes grid, and not controled for quality
